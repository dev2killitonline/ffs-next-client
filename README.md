# Starter Project

This project comes with the following features out of the box:

1. [Google Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-google-analytics)
2. [Google Tag Manager](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-google-tag-manager)
3. [Sitemap Generation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sitemap)

Each of these was derived from an official example documented on the [NextJs examples repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples)

## Styling

Styling has not been loaded into this template because there are a number of different implementations. If you choose to add styling beyond the basic css please limit it to one of the following options. (or check out the [NextJs Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support))

### Scss

```javascript
npm install sass
// or
yarn add sass
```

For additional info consult the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support)
