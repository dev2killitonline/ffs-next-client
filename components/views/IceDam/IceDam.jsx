              Severe flood damage can lead to a wide array of unpleasant
              effects. It can cause discoloration in carpeting, furniture,
              walls, and wood flooring. Musty odors are usually accompanied by
              significant bacterial and mold growth. Structural components can
              soften from lack of proper drying due to rot and decay. More times
              than not, most of the damage exists under or inside of building
              components such as walls.
